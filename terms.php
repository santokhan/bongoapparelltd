                <p>We’re updating our Terms of Service on January 5, 2022 to make it easier for you to understand what to expect from Bongo — and what we expect from you — as you use our services.
                    Until
                    then, the Terms below continue to apply.</p>

            <p>What’s covered in these terms?</p>
            <p>We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Bongo services, and what we expect from you.</p>
            <p>These Terms of Service reflect the way Google’s business works, the laws that apply to our company, and certain things we’ve always believed to be true. As a result, these Terms of
                Service help define</p>
            <p>Google’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:</p>
            <p>What you can expect from us, which describes how we provide and develop our services?</p>
            <p>What we expect from you, which establishes certain rules for using our services?</p>
            <p>Content in Bongo services, which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you find in our services — whether that content belongs to you, Bongo, or others
                In case of problems or disagreements, which describes other legal rights you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms</p>
            <p>Understanding these terms is important because, by using our services, you’re agreeing to these terms.</p>
            <p>Besides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy. Although it’s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage, export, and
                delete your information. Service provider</p>
